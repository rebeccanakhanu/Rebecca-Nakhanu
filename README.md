Project Title:Week1 Toy Problems

Project Description
The project contains solutions for three toy problems in JavaScript: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

The Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator takes input from the user in the range of 0 to 100 and outputs the corresponding grade, which could be A, B, C, D, or E.The Student Grade Generator is supposed to take input from the user in the range of 0-100 and then output the corresponding grade based on a defined grading criteria as shown below:
A > 79
B - 60 to 79
C - 59 to 49
D - 40 to 49
E - less than 40

The speed Detector
The Speed Detector program is designed to take the speed of a car as input, and then output a message based on the speed limit and the number of demerit points earned by the driver. The program works as follows:
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, the program should output the message "Ok".
If the speed is 70 km/h or more, the program should calculate the number of demerit points earned by the driver. For every 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), the driver earns one demerit point.
After calculating the number of demerit points, the program should output the number of demerit points earned by the driver.
If the driver earns more than 12 demerit points, the program should output the message "License suspended".
For example, if the driver is going at a speed of 80 km/h, the program should output "Points: 2", since the driver is going 10 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h), and earns 2 demerit points.

The Net Salary Calculator 
The Net Salary Calculator is supposed to take the inputs of an individual's basic salary and benefits and calculate the following values:

Payee (i.e. Tax)
NHIF Deductions
NSSF Deductions
Gross Salary
Net Salary
These values are calculated using the tax rates provided by KRA, NHIF, and NSSF, which can be found in the links provided in the challenge description. The output should be the calculated values of all the above mentioned components.These  are the links to help calculate the above
